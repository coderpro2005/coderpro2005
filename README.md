- 👋 Hi, I’m @coderpro2005 and I study in 11th grade.
- 👀 I’m currently interested in learning about python. 
     I have moderate experience working with Arduino and its applications in Robotics. 
     I have created numerous projects and worked with the school robotics team in the past.
     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and its application in various fields. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python learning. This is a part time hobby activity, currently I cannot devote all my time in this. 
      However I look forward to new experiences and learning. I just have a little time constraint.
- 📫 Ypu can reach me via my email.
